# Surface Risk Notes



# Overview

This repository contains notes and pattern-based observations on surface-level risks seen across modern web applications, with a focus on authentication logic and misconfiguration awareness.

The goal is to document how risk commonly appears, not to enumerate or exploit specific vulnerabilities.

# Scope
What this repository covers:

Publicly observable application surfaces
Authentication and access flow assumptions
Common misconfiguration patterns
Risk prioritization from a defender’s perspective
What this repository does not cover:
Exploitation techniques
Active scanning or testing
Targeted assessments of real organizations
Proof-of-concept attacks

# Methodology
All observations are derived from:

Passive analysis of publicly accessible application behavior
Pattern recognition across multiple application designs
Non-intrusive, simulated review techniques
No interaction with backend systems, protected endpoints, or private data is performed.

# Intended Audience
SaaS founders and small product teams
Developers interested in risk-aware design
Security learners focusing on application logic rather than tooling
This material is written to be understandable without a security background.

# Disclaimer
All content in this repository is non-intrusive, simulated, and provided for educational and defensive purposes only.
No exploitation, scanning, or unauthorized access is performed or encouraged.

# Notes
This is a living set of notes and may evolve over time.
